          each foot on each step as to not slip and fall into the unknown. However this
          is a very long stairway, there can't be any harm in hurrying it up, but your first
          step with pep results in you falling and tumbling in the dark down the stairs. When
          you finally land at the base of the stairs you find yourself in a dimly lit room with
          a man looking down on you.  </p>
