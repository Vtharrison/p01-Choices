        <p class="bodytext"> You wake up, your head is fuzzy and have no recollection of
          how you got here but you are in a room. While this isn't the worst place you have
          ever woken up without knowing how or when you got here, you are more concerned than
          usual. You check your pockets to not find anything in them, after a quick scan of the
          room you quickly realize you don't have much choice. The only source of light is a
          skylight high above your head and there are two doors on either end of the room, one
          is a worn down poorly varnished wooden door with a surprisingly polished brass doorknob,
          the other is a heavy metal door with a rusty metal handle.</p>
