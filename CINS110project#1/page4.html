            reduced to scraps and you are able to walk through. This is not the room you
            came from, this room is lined wall to wall with doors you approach a door and
            try to open it, it doesn't work, you try another one, it doesn't work,you try
            another one, it doesn't work, they all don't work they all must be fake doors.
            In your panic you get disoriented, you can't tell which doors you have tried
            and those you haven't, you realize you have to think about this rationally,
            after some deliberation you see yourself having two options.</p>
