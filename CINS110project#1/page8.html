          appeared to be an old mahogany that was very well kept. This was the kind
          of wood floor you don't cover up because when people see it they will be
          like &quot;WOW! Thats a nice floor&quot; at least the first time they see
          it, I do suppose the only reason it was so nice is that the carpet was covering
          it. Your choices are obvious. </p>
