            out of this place before whoever the maniac who put you here finds you. You take
            a swing at the wall and it gives in surprisingly easy, a few more swings and you
            make a hole big enough to fit through. Once you are through you bolt towards the
            nearest fence but you hear men approaching, quickly. They swiftly gain on you and
            there yelling becomes clearer, &quot;Its just a prank bro!&quot; </p>
